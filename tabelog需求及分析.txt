We are currently serviceable/expanding to following area (prefectures): Tokyo(東京都), Kanagawa(神奈川県), Osaka(大阪府), Kyoto(京都府), Hyogo(兵庫県)

Would it be possible to narrow down area and increase data points within these area?
Please see below for lat/lng coordinate for following area.
                    Tokyo/Yokohama	        Osaka	                Hyogo	                Kyoto
Top Left	    35.8094, 139.55597	34.78222, 135.3701	    34.81605, 135.07827	    35.08732, 135.68939
Bottom Right	35.40919, 139.8999	34.57895, 135.61248	    34.65548, 135.485	    34.8679, 135.86517
Would these be sufficient?


Sorry for keep spamming you again. Do you have an update on this?
We are planning on distributing DMs (postal mails, not email) to restaurants, and we would like a list of restaurants at latest by the end of this month.
Do you think this is feasible? Thank you!

My name is Risa and I am from Uber Eats Japan team. Please let us know when Tabelog data is ready, as we have been planing projects which require these data sets. Please let me know if additional information is needed. 


Hi Jiaxianfu,
Thank you for the file. Yes please let us know if there are any technical difficulties, then we can consider alternative websites as options as well. 
I expect the dataset from each city to be at least twice bigger knowing how many restaurants we have... but if its the structure of website that is prohibiting data collection, please let us know.
Thank you very much!
Best,Risa

Hello Bijie (is it your correct way to spell your first name?),Thank you very much for data set!. We really appreciate your prompt support on this.My name is Risa from Uber Eats Japan team, and I work with restaurant acquisition team on planning and analytics. I'm very excited about being able to see more details on Tabelog data.I'm reaching out to see if it is possible for us to make some requests on these data set Labeling each Tabelog page

新需求
Is it possible to request to add some kind of ID to label each Tabelog page? For example, if there is "Yunfutech Uber Eats Restaurant", I want to be able to track each restaurant every time we receive these data set.
How our team uses these data set is to distribute direct mails or plan sales acquisition. We would like to distinguish ones that one "untouched" from ones that we have already reached out.
采集中的重复，用坐标爬取需要去重，id号码抓取就不存在重复了
There are some duplicate in dataset as well as inconsistency with numbers, so I want to be able to track each restaurant when we receive a new data set every month. 

基于地区采集数据可行？
Selecting Data based on "addressRegion" instead of Latitude and Longitude info。I believe this time we have received data from all over Japan. We provided Lat&Lng to select region, but instead, could you filter and collect data based on "addressRegion"? (like 東京、神奈川、大阪、Etc.)
By accurately selecting region, we can remove data points that we do not need and increase the amount of data points in where we need (i.e. Tokyo) which hopefully helps both our business purpose and your team's operation.
If these are not feasible request, please let me know. However, these restaurants data is very important to our day-to-day business operations so I want to explore every way that we can work with these data set. 
Please let me know if there are any concerns or questions - happy to help. 


通过ID抓取信息：
构造url类似sql注入攻击
https://tabelog.com/tokyo/B8304/B830401/13211121
主域名/city/AXXXX/AXXXXXX/id
这样根据id采集的信息比较多，里面有不存在的餐厅以及close的，后期客户如果需求就进一步处理

目前抓取的城市有东京，大阪，神户（隶属兵库县），横滨（隶属神奈川），京都
其中神户，横滨可以分别从冰库和神奈川筛选出

大阪餐厅分析前150，餐厅状态分以下五种，最后要的餐饮是那些正常营业的，shop_status字段标记了餐厅状态，其中为空的就是正常营业的
